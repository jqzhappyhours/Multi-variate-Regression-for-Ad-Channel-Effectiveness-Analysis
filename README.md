# Multi-variate-Regression-for-Ad-Channel-Effectiveness-Analysis

In this project, we analyzed a consmetics firm's advertising effectiveness using multi-variate linear regression. More specifically, we evaluated the effect of each ad channel on total sales. We accounted for the diminishing return of advertising by applying functional form to the regression model. We tried various types of data transformations and used stepwise regression to address multicollinearity issue within the data.
